            <h5 class="fw-bold text-dark mt-4">Our History</h5>
            <p>Founded in 2004, ANTS began with a vision to equip leaders in Uganda who lacked formal theological training. From a humble beginning with just 12 students, the college has grown into a premier institution attracting students from across East Africa.</p>
            
            <h5 class="fw-bold text-dark mt-4">Our Philosophy</h5>
            <p>We believe in "Head, Heart, and Hands" training. It is not enough to know the Bible intellectually; one must be transformed spiritually and equipped practically for service.</p>
